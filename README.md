# BitU - Payments made simple!

This mobile application is developed to be used at a POS (Point-of-sale) while making transaction. The vendor (or it can be a customer) will use this app and generate a link for the payment to be made.

## Getting Started

The way the app works is, a purchase is made at a POS (Point-of-Sale) and the link for payment is generated. This link can be shared among any number of people to make the payment as per the convenience. Remote and unequal payment can be realized using the application.

The whole system consists of a back-end written in Python Flask, a web Interface and an android app. This repo only deals with the vendor android app.
